For me its ""I’d been having a fun life and not saving for the future … Crypto was my chance to catch up"" but guess what I'm no where near catching up. i lost 10 months worth of salary with btc x20 leverage 

then I earned back slowly by buy/sell altcoins at 10% profit

lost all in a month, earned it back in a year",0.44027777777777777,0.15555555555555556,Positive
"I had a 830 credit score, 0 debt other than a mortgage i was over paying each month and in late 2021 decided to try my hand in the crypto world.
I took a Heloc loan out and had $75k cash in my bank to dabble the world of crypto with.  Back then i didn't know what a bull and bear market was.  I somehow joined right at peak bull market as it was about to crash down.
I joined many crypto discord servers that promised large gains really quickly.  Sometimes it worked, most of the time it didn't and started losing more than gaining.  
One discord server I was on seemed to be doing really well so I started adding more and more money into a coin that i saw was going up.  A coin called Wonderland Time (TIME).  Not only was the price going up, but I could stake it and earn more coin each day.  Their website had a calculator on how much money I would make over a year based on its price and crazy high APY.  I was supposed to make many many millions from my investment of $50k I had at the time.  (they called this the 'lambo calculator' on the website)
Lost about $8k trying to make easy money by adding cash to fake 'exchanges' that told me when a coin was going to pump.  When it did, they asked for thousands more to withdraw and i just felt bad at being scammed.
TIME coin started falling in price along with the entire market, but I thought it was a great time to buy more as everyone said it was going to go back up.  I put the rest of my loan into the coin and even maxed out a credit card over a month of putting more money into it.  I watched daily as the price and my net worth dropped from over $98k at its peak to selling the coin at a loss to keep $27k.  and it went even lower after I sold, if i kept it even 3 days longer, i would have just $7k to my name.
I told myself no more meme coins and put what I had left into a much more reliable coin and held during the bear market.
I'm back to having over $80k in crypto net worth and this bull run will boost me well over my initial investment, but I learned a hard lesson.  My credit score is in the upper 680's now and I still pay the interest of my debts to this day.  I hope to clear all debts next year.","Those who came across huge financial losses in crypto, tell us how it happened and how you are doing now

**2. Wallet Options**

You could try Ledger. The following is the URL confirmation for the supported coins.

I checked, LUNA and H20 DAO are supported, but not LUNC. In this instance, you could consider parking your H2O Dao and LUNA in a Cold Wallet, while leaving LUNC on the exchange.

"Very good performing coin this year so far. It’s lasted many times throughout the years and has a good rep.

RSR is an ERC-20 token that was launched in May 2019. It operates within the Reserve Protocol, which allows the creation of RTokens, which are stablecoins backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies.

According to their info: 

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token has two main functions in the Reserve Protocol: 

Overcollateralization

RSR can be staked to overcollateralize Reserve stablecoins (RTokens). Staked RSR is the first capital at risk in the event of a collateral default, and in exchange, it receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue.

Governance

RSR can be used to propose and vote on changes to the configuration of RTokens.


hope this helps but i believe in this coin. It will help with tokenisation of assets and inflation by backing either the RTokens.","Hi CC fam.
