Support group for crypti scams ,"I am a crypto vet with third cycle. I made a lot and lost most of them in high level scams like Luna UST and Multichain. 

Even after years I still have bad taste about the stuff. I can't let it go with simple. At least you are in the green, which I am very thankful for but the ""what ifs"" are killing me. Losing 85% of your portfolio does a lot to your mentality. 

I think my main problem it that I have no one to talk to about it. There was forum for Luna victims but it is since abandoned.

Is there any reputable subreedit or forum to discuss this. 

I need to vent. 

And don't bother dming me your scam links. I will just ignore you",0,3,0.45,1hvszxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hvszxa/support_group_for_crypti_scams/,You can post screenshots of you losses on r/wallstreetbets those guys always help each other get over losses through humor,4,1736261238.0,2025-01-07 14:47:18

Most people here lost a lot of money from LUNA and FTX either directly or indirectly because the market crashed.


I myself lost 75% from peak to the bottom. You just need to keep going. Now I'm up 1600% since the bottom.",-1,1736261238.0,2025-01-07 14:47:18
