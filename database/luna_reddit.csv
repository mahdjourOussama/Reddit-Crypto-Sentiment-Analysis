Sweet DeFi Summer 2.0: Return of the APY ,"DeFi: Decentralised Finance. We’ve heard the term ""DeFi"" a million times, but what does it actually mean? And what was DeFi Summer all about?

DeFi’s been knocking about for years, but it went nuclear last cycle with Ethereum’s rise and all the Layer 2 madness. Suddenly, everyone was diving headfirst into it. DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap (Sushi wars anyone?) blew up, and their tokens were minting like mad.

Fast forward to now—AI’s is trendy, and everyone’s crapping themselves over quantum computing. You’ve even got quantum-focused cryptos trying to steal the spotlight. Bit hard to value if you and me as I'm not sure we can really predict what quantum computing will do to finance as a whole, nevermind crypto. 

My question is: does DeFi still have a place? Its original rise caught loads of people off guard, so could something else just as unexpected sneak in this time?

DeFi popped off hardest during 2021. Loads of people piled in, chasing crazy APY returns. I won't lie I was chasing it too and thought that shit would never end. Remember LUNA? Yeah, that promised the world and ended up taking everyone to hell. 

It has to be said that the large APY returns proved a lot of the haters right... That shit just was NOT sustainable.

What I'm wondering is, do we reckon APY greed will pull people back into crypto? Or has that phase passed?

For me, all signs are pointing at SushiSwap. 

Konnichiwa, Regards.

SushiSwap had a mad December, pumping hard and even gaining against BTC—a rare sight these days. DeFi still seems to have eyes on it, and I reckon we could see the hype really kick off come spring 2025.

What about you lot? Any of you deep in DeFi projects? Locking your equity for sexy APYs? And what chains are you betting on for the next DeFi boom? Or is it AI/LLM/ random shit like FIL that you think will get the most attention? 

",0,8,0.33,1hp6mig,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hp6mig/sweet_defi_summer_20_return_of_the_apy/,"Speaking on my own experience with DeFi, those crazy high xxxx% APY returns are red flags. Not to mention that unless you’re one of the very first into a pool with a sizeable amount, you’re not necessarily going to get those massive returns. Diminishing is the name of the game and I think that fact is often overlooked when people see a ridiculous %. 

I kinda take the stance of - If you’re hearing about it second hand, it’s already too late. 

For me, having to lock up assets to get some sort of theoretical value in the future in the same or another coin is not something I’m interested in doing, anymore. 2021 and LUNA as you mentioned was lesson enough for me to recognize that I got burnt more than I made.

SushiSwap had a mad December, pumping hard and even gaining against BTC—a rare sight these days. DeFi still seems to have eyes on it, and I reckon we could see the hype really kick off come spring 2025.

What about you lot? Any of you deep in DeFi projects? Locking your equity for sexy APYs? And what chains are you betting on for the next DeFi boom? Or is it AI/LLM/ random shit like FIL that you think will get the most attention?

Tax Loss Harvesting Terra Classic - Need Help Burning Worthless $LUNC Tokens,"Hey everyone,

Thanks to Do Kwon’s “brilliant” leadership and the criminal charges that followed, I’m still holding a pile of worthless LUNA. Silver lining - it's time to dump it to offset 2024 gains for tax purposes.

To properly realize the tax loss in the USA, I need to either sell or send my LUNA tokens to a burn address. I found this one: `terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu`

Here’s the problem: Gemini (which no longer supports trading) doesn’t seem to offer the Terra network as an option when setting up a withdrawal address. I’ve reached out to their support, but after almost a week with no response, I’m turning to the crypto community for help.

Has anyone successfully burned their LUNA tokens from Gemini? What’s the process? Any advice would be hugely appreciated - I’d like to get *something* positive out of this mess. Thanks in advance!",2,3,0.75,1hngpvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hngpvl/tax_loss_harvesting_terra_classic_need_help/,"Thanks to your brilliant custodianship, those tokens might be stuck there indefinitely

idk that the irs is proficient to know the difference between you burning them 'properly' and you sending them 'somewhere' that isn't your wallet and calling them burned

can you select any network as an option for withdrawal?",3,1735311770.0,2024-12-27 15:02:50
SEC charges Jump Crypto subsidiary $123 million for manipulating Terra Luna UST peg,,7,6,0.71,1hkkcx1,https://cryptoslate.com/sec-charges-jump-crypto-subsidiary-123-million-for-manipulating-terra-luna-ust-peg/,"tldr; The SEC has charged Tai Mo Shan Limited, a subsidiary of Jump Crypto, with misleading investors about Terra USD (UST) after it lost its $1 peg. The SEC alleges Tai Mo Shan engaged in trading to falsely suggest UST's algorithm maintained its price, when in fact, Tai Mo Shan's $20 million purchase helped restore the peg. The firm will pay $123 million in penalties and disgorgement. Tai Mo Shan also distributed LUNA as unregistered securities. The case highlights the reliance on external support to maintain UST's value, contrary to public claims by Terraform Labs.

I took a Heloc loan out and had $75k cash in my bank to dabble the world of crypto with.  Back then i didn't know what a bull and bear market was.  I somehow joined right at peak bull market as it was about to crash down.
I joined many crypto discord servers that promised large gains really quickly.  Sometimes it worked, most of the time it didn't and started losing more than gaining.  
One discord server I was on seemed to be doing really well so I started adding more and more money into a coin that i saw was going up.  A coin called Wonderland Time (TIME).  Not only was the price going up, but I could stake it and earn more coin each day.  Their website had a calculator on how much money I would make over a year based on its price and crazy high APY.  I was supposed to make many many millions from my investment of $50k I had at the time.  (they called this the 'lambo calculator' on the website)
Lost about $8k trying to make easy money by adding cash to fake 'exchanges' that told me when a coin was going to pump.  When it did, they asked for thousands more to withdraw and i just felt bad at being scammed.
TIME coin started falling in price along with the entire market, but I thought it was a great time to buy more as everyone said it was going to go back up.  I put the rest of my loan into the coin and even maxed out a credit card over a month of putting more money into it.  I watched daily as the price and my net worth dropped from over $98k at its peak to selling the coin at a loss to keep $27k.  and it went even lower after I sold, if i kept it even 3 days longer, i would have just $7k to my name.
I told myself no more meme coins and put what I had left into a much more reliable coin and held during the bear market.
I'm back to having over $80k in crypto net worth and this bull run will boost me well over my initial investment, but I learned a hard lesson.  My credit score is in the upper 680's now and I still pay the interest of my debts to this day.  I hope to clear all debts next year.",6,1734460224.0,2024-12-17 18:30:24

Question about old LUNA,"In any case - I don't answer DMs.

So I have an old wallet with some old Wrapped LUNA. I understand what happened, but while it happened I did not have the means to do anything about it so I just had to watch (away -sob). I did not want to deal with it.

I think to understand that those coins are now termed LUNC.

I wanted to send these coins to Binance (yes, probably the tx fee are higher than the total value of the coins, yes it's futile, etc.. Nevermind).

Can I send these coins anywhere at all or will they stick forever as a dark reminder in that wallet?

The LUNC deposit address in Binance starts with `terra1....`. If I enter that into my sending UI it says the destination address is invalid. I guess that means that my sender is on Ethereum, while Binance is on some other address.

Is there any way to get those LUNA/C to Binance?",0,1,0.17,1hdkcxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hdkcxf/question_about_old_luna/,"The reason why the Binance destination address is showing invalid is because it’s wrapped.

**1. Finding the market.** 

I use Coingecko often. You can check under the URL below for LUNC's market. Binance is listed. I believe you should be able to use it to trade them.

[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna-classic](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna-classic)

In the future, it's a good reference point to find the crypto that you like, and the available market that's trading it.

**2. Wallet Options**

You could try Ledger. The following is the URL confirmation for the supported coins.

[https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

I checked, LUNA and H20 DAO are supported, but not LUNC. In this instance, you could consider parking your H2O Dao and LUNA in a Cold Wallet, while leaving LUNC on the exchange.

I buy some here and there as a long term investment to completely forget about it on the off chance that I get somewhat lucky and make some decent money. I bought some LUNC, H20 DAO, and LUNA on KuCoin nearly 3 years ago. I invest because I believe in crypto but the blockchain/network technology is just above my head. I google and do tons of ""research"" and reading but some things I just can't figure out. Luckily I logged into KuCoin several days ago amid all of the crypto boom noise and realized their US service is going away and all assets have to be withdrawn by December 17. I also had some XRP on there and successfully withdrew it. My problem now is with the LUNC, H20 DAO, and LUNA. I have accounts on several other crypto exchanges but I'm having trouble withdrawing these 3 specific assets. I thought Kraken would be the way to go but they don't have LUNC specifically...just LUNA. I read about the LUNC/LUNA issues and realize they're different but the reasoning and everything is beyond me. KuCoin won't allow me to convert because of the US restriction and I don't even know if converting is what I should do. Is LUNC even supported anymore or able to be held somewhere? Bottom line is I am trying to withdraw these 3 assets from KuCoin to store on another exchange. I've been researching and reading through tons of reddit questions relating to this and I'm currently just at a standstill while the December 17th deadline approaches. Does anyone know what exchange I can receive and store these specific 3 coins/tokens/assets on? Any advice greatly appreciated.",3,26,0.57,1hbbyp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hbbyp6/asking_for_advice/,You've been shitcoined. Sorry and good luck. My advice is to convert it all to BTC and at start over if you can figure out how to withdraw,1,1733863929.0,2024-12-10 20:52:09

The better option in my opinion is a self custody wallet such as Trust Wallet.",1,1733863929.0,2024-12-10 20:52:09

The Reserve Rights Foundation and RSR token - anyone knows how this protocol and its token work?,"Hi CC fam.

It seems that Paul Atkins is now chosen to lead the SEC.

We don't know yet and will find out very soon how this will affect the cryptomarket for better or worse (I'm holding my beer here since before being SEC chair, Garry Gensler was also very much crypto supportive (and he turned villain since then).

Neverthelss, it seems that the upcoming SEC chair Paul Atkins was ball deep in cryptoverse. And today I learned that he used to be advisor of the Reserve Rights Foundation (I read the news [here ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rsr-token-soars-88-former-081918826.html)in case you are wondering what is this all about).

Apparently there's market FOMO (and may not end well) when a lot of people are pouring hard-earned money into RSR, the token of Reserve Rights Foundation. So I'm just curious if you know anything about this protocol and its token? It seems to be a platform to issue stablecoin. But I have no ideas how it actually works (and is it like Terra/Luna or so. The pain is still in my a\*\* spitting these aweful words from my mouth).

Thanks in advance.",7,5,0.65,1h6zgho,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1h6zgho/the_reserve_rights_foundation_and_rsr_token/,No harm in throwing $50 at it,2,1733368615.0,2024-12-05 03:16:55

RSR is an ERC-20 token that was launched in May 2019. It operates within the Reserve Protocol, which allows the creation of RTokens, which are stablecoins backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies.

According to their info: 

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token has two main functions in the Reserve Protocol: 

Overcollateralization

RSR can be staked to overcollateralize Reserve stablecoins (RTokens). Staked RSR is the first capital at risk in the event of a collateral default, and in exchange, it receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue.

Governance

RSR can be used to propose and vote on changes to the configuration of RTokens.


hope this helps but i believe in this coin. It will help with tokenisation of assets and inflation by backing either the RTokens.",2,1733368615.0,2024-12-05 03:16:55
