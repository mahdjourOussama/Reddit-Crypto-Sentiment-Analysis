"Hi CC fam.

It seems that Paul Atkins is now chosen to lead the SEC.

We don't know yet and will find out very soon how this will affect the cryptomarket for better or worse (I'm holding my beer here since before being SEC chair, Garry Gensler was also very much crypto supportive (and he turned villain since then).

Neverthelss, it seems that the upcoming SEC chair Paul Atkins was ball deep in cryptoverse. And today I learned that he used to be advisor of the Reserve Rights Foundation (I read the news [here ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rsr-token-soars-88-former-081918826.html)in case you are wondering what is this all about).

Apparently there's market FOMO (and may not end well) when a lot of people are pouring hard-earned money into RSR, the token of Reserve Rights Foundation. So I'm just curious if you know anything about this protocol and its token? It seems to be a platform to issue stablecoin. But I have no ideas how it actually works (and is it like Terra/Luna or so. The pain is still in my a\*\* spitting these aweful words from my mouth).

Thanks in advance.",No harm in throwing $50 at it,2,1h6zgho

Thanks in advance.","Very good performing coin this year so far. It’s lasted many times throughout the years and has a good rep.

RSR is an ERC-20 token that was launched in May 2019. It operates within the Reserve Protocol, which allows the creation of RTokens, which are stablecoins backed by a basket of cryptocurrencies.

According to their info: 

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token has two main functions in the Reserve Protocol: 

Overcollateralization

RSR can be staked to overcollateralize Reserve stablecoins (RTokens). Staked RSR is the first capital at risk in the event of a collateral default, and in exchange, it receives a portion of the RToken collateral’s revenue.

Governance

RSR can be used to propose and vote on changes to the configuration of RTokens.


hope this helps but i believe in this coin. It will help with tokenisation of assets and inflation by backing either the RTokens.",2,1h6zgho
