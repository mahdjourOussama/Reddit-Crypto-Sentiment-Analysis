Support group for crypti scams ,"I am a crypto vet with third cycle. I made a lot and lost most of them in high level scams like Luna UST and Multichain. 

Even after years I still have bad taste about the stuff. I can't let it go with simple. At least you are in the green, which I am very thankful for but the ""what ifs"" are killing me. Losing 85% of your portfolio does a lot to your mentality. 

I think my main problem it that I have no one to talk to about it. There was forum for Luna victims but it is since abandoned.

Is there any reputable subreedit or forum to discuss this. 

I need to vent. 

And don't bother dming me your scam links. I will just ignore you",0,3,0.42,1hvszxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hvszxa/support_group_for_crypti_scams/,1736261238.0,2025-01-07 14:47:18
Is squid game s2 making fun of Do Kwon?,"In squid game s2, reference is made to an influencer who convinced some contestants to invest in a rugpull coin. I thought maybe they were making fun of Do Kwon and all the people he scammed when Luna went down the drain.

Also interesting was the fact squid game was trying to lump crypto investors in the category of gamblers considering the crypto contestants were competing with run of the mill gamblers.

And the ironic thing about this is that people are now reinvesting money into a new squid game rugpull scheme. The irony in squid game making fun of crypto scammers only to have people invest in a scam is laughable.",0,19,0.48,1hplpwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hplpwy/is_squid_game_s2_making_fun_of_do_kwon/,1735559860.0,2024-12-30 11:57:40
Sweet DeFi Summer 2.0: Return of the APY ,"DeFi: Decentralised Finance. We’ve heard the term ""DeFi"" a million times, but what does it actually mean? And what was DeFi Summer all about?

DeFi’s been knocking about for years, but it went nuclear last cycle with Ethereum’s rise and all the Layer 2 madness. Suddenly, everyone was diving headfirst into it. DEXs like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and SushiSwap (Sushi wars anyone?) blew up, and their tokens were minting like mad.

Fast forward to now—AI’s is trendy, and everyone’s crapping themselves over quantum computing. You’ve even got quantum-focused cryptos trying to steal the spotlight. Bit hard to value if you and me as I'm not sure we can really predict what quantum computing will do to finance as a whole, nevermind crypto. 

My question is: does DeFi still have a place? Its original rise caught loads of people off guard, so could something else just as unexpected sneak in this time?

DeFi popped off hardest during 2021. Loads of people piled in, chasing crazy APY returns. I won't lie I was chasing it too and thought that shit would never end. Remember LUNA? Yeah, that promised the world and ended up taking everyone to hell. 

It has to be said that the large APY returns proved a lot of the haters right... That shit just was NOT sustainable.

What I'm wondering is, do we reckon APY greed will pull people back into crypto? Or has that phase passed?

For me, all signs are pointing at SushiSwap. 

Konnichiwa, Regards.

SushiSwap had a mad December, pumping hard and even gaining against BTC—a rare sight these days. DeFi still seems to have eyes on it, and I reckon we could see the hype really kick off come spring 2025.

What about you lot? Any of you deep in DeFi projects? Locking your equity for sexy APYs? And what chains are you betting on for the next DeFi boom? Or is it AI/LLM/ random shit like FIL that you think will get the most attention?

Tax Loss Harvesting Terra Classic - Need Help Burning Worthless $LUNC Tokens,"Hey everyone,

Thanks to Do Kwon’s “brilliant” leadership and the criminal charges that followed, I’m still holding a pile of worthless LUNA. Silver lining - it's time to dump it to offset 2024 gains for tax purposes.

To properly realize the tax loss in the USA, I need to either sell or send my LUNA tokens to a burn address. I found this one: `terra1sk06e3dyexuq4shw77y3dsv480xv42mq73anxu`

Here’s the problem: Gemini (which no longer supports trading) doesn’t seem to offer the Terra network as an option when setting up a withdrawal address. I’ve reached out to their support, but after almost a week with no response, I’m turning to the crypto community for help.

Has anyone successfully burned their LUNA tokens from Gemini? What’s the process? Any advice would be hugely appreciated - I’d like to get *something* positive out of this mess.

Incurred a financial loss in crypto? How? Why? Tell us. ,"Those who came across huge financial losses in crypto, tell us how it happened and how you are doing now


“If I’d sold everything, I would’ve had a quarter of a million pounds"" and “If I’d sold everything, I would’ve had a quarter of a million pounds,” are the things we have probably heard before in the past. But how true are these stories...

I want to hear especially from the people who were in huge into Terra Luna, Safemoon  and so forth. Disasters happen but its more of how we overcome such disasters and how we can stay afloat. It's important to talk about this today then ever before. 

For me its ""I’d been having a fun life and not saving for the future … Crypto was my chance to catch up"" but guess what I'm no where near catching up.

Question about old LUNA,"In any case - I don't answer DMs.

So I have an old wallet with some old Wrapped LUNA. I understand what happened, but while it happened I did not have the means to do anything about it so I just had to watch (away -sob). I did not want to deal with it.

I think to understand that those coins are now termed LUNC.

I wanted to send these coins to Binance (yes, probably the tx fee are higher than the total value of the coins, yes it's futile, etc.. Nevermind).

Can I send these coins anywhere at all or will they stick forever as a dark reminder in that wallet?

The LUNC deposit address in Binance starts with `terra1....`. If I enter that into my sending UI it says the destination address is invalid. I guess that means that my sender is on Ethereum, while Binance is on some other address.

Is there any way to get those LUNA/C to Binance?",0,1,0.38,1hdkcxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hdkcxf/question_about_old_luna/,1734118673.0,2024-12-13 19:37:53
Asking for advice,"I'm not completely new. I have been buying/investing in crypto for several years. I buy some here and there as a long term investment to completely forget about it on the off chance that I get somewhat lucky and make some decent money. I bought some LUNC, H20 DAO, and LUNA on KuCoin nearly 3 years ago. I invest because I believe in crypto but the blockchain/network technology is just above my head. I google and do tons of ""research"" and reading but some things I just can't figure out. Luckily I logged into KuCoin several days ago amid all of the crypto boom noise and realized their US service is going away and all assets have to be withdrawn by December 17. I also had some XRP on there and successfully withdrew it. My problem now is with the LUNC, H20 DAO, and LUNA. I have accounts on several other crypto exchanges but I'm having trouble withdrawing these 3 specific assets. I thought Kraken would be the way to go but they don't have LUNC specifically...just LUNA. I read about the LUNC/LUNA issues and realize they're different but the reasoning and everything is beyond me. KuCoin won't allow me to convert because of the US restriction and I don't even know if converting is what I should do. Is LUNC even supported anymore or able to be held somewhere? Bottom line is I am trying to withdraw these 3 assets from KuCoin to store on another exchange. I've been researching and reading through tons of reddit questions relating to this and I'm currently just at a standstill while the December 17th deadline approaches. Does anyone know what exchange I can receive and store these specific 3 coins/tokens/assets on? Any advice greatly appreciated.",2,26,0.56,1hbbyp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1hbbyp6/asking_for_advice/,1733863929.0,2024-12-10 20:52:09
The Reserve Rights Foundation and RSR token - anyone knows how this protocol and its token work?,"Hi CC fam.

It seems that Paul Atkins is now chosen to lead the SEC.

We don't know yet and will find out very soon how this will affect the cryptomarket for better or worse (I'm holding my beer here since before being SEC chair, Garry Gensler was also very much crypto supportive (and he turned villain since then).

Neverthelss, it seems that the upcoming SEC chair Paul Atkins was ball deep in cryptoverse. And today I learned that he used to be advisor of the Reserve Rights Foundation (I read the news [here ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rsr-token-soars-88-former-081918826.html)in case you are wondering what is this all about).

Apparently there's market FOMO (and may not end well) when a lot of people are pouring hard-earned money into RSR, the token of Reserve Rights Foundation. So I'm just curious if you know anything about this protocol and its token? It seems to be a platform to issue stablecoin. But I have no ideas how it actually works (and is it like Terra/Luna or so. The pain is still in my a\*\* spitting these aweful words from my mouth).
